	abstract = {We address the long-standing problem of iteration count and time step dependent constraint stiffness in position-based dynamics (PBD). We introduce a simple extension to PBD that allows it to accurately and efﬁciently simulate arbitrary elastic and dissipative energy potentials in an implicit manner. In addition, our method provides constraint force estimates, making it applicable to a wider range of applications, such those requiring haptic user-feedback. We compare our algorithm to more expensive non-linear solvers and ﬁnd it produces visually similar results while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of the PBD method.},
